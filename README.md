# Additional Politics
Mod for Vic3 that adds additional diplomatic actions.

Mod is still experimental.

My vision for the mod is to make politics more interesting, ideally every country should feel unique to play and there should be multiple strategies the player can employ.

My initial goals are to make playing as an authoritarian be viable and feel different. To do this I will add more actions that require authority to use. 
Secondly I want to add more country-specific interest groups and also ways to interact with them. At the moment you bolster and add an interest group to government when you need them. I want interest groups to be a double edged sword, they may share your interests up to a certain point but they can be dangerous if bolstered too far.
Thirdly I want every interest group to have more perks and drawbacks.
